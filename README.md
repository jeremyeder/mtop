**See llm-d in action: GPU-aware scheduling, SLO-driven autoscaling, and cost optimization for LLM workloads.**

## What is llm-d?

[llm-d](https://llm-d.ai) is Red Hat's open source platform for deploying and managing Large Language Models at scale. It provides:

- **GPU-Aware Orchestration**: Intelligent scheduling across heterogeneous GPU clusters (H100, A100, DRA)
- **SLO-Driven Operations**: Automatic scaling based on Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) and latency targets
- **Cost Intelligence**: 40% reduction in GPU costs through dynamic right-sizing and bin-packing
- **Enterprise Integration**: Native OpenShift/Kubernetes integration with RBAC and multi-tenancy

## About This Demo

mtop simulates a production llm-d environment without requiring a live cluster, allowing you to:

- Demonstrate llm-d's real-time monitoring capabilities
- Showcase SLO convergence and autoscaling behavior
- Illustrate GPU utilization optimization
- Present cost savings through intelligent scheduling

## Quick Demo

```bash
# Show llm-d's real-time monitoring
./mtop-main

# Demonstrate SLO-driven autoscaling
./mtop-main slo-dashboard

# Showcase deployment strategies
./mtop-main simulate canary
```

## Key llm-d Capabilities Demonstrated

### üéØ SLO-Driven Autoscaling
![slo-compliance](recordings/sales/slo-compliance.gif)

llm-d automatically scales deployments to meet TTFT and latency targets while minimizing cost.

### üí∞ Intelligent Cost Optimization
![cost-optimization](recordings/sales/cost-optimization.gif)

GPU-aware bin-packing and right-sizing reduces infrastructure costs by up to 40%.

### üî• Heterogeneous GPU Management
![gpu-efficiency](recordings/sales/gpu-efficiency.gif)

Seamlessly manage H100, A100, and DRA clusters with unified scheduling and monitoring.

### üìä Enterprise-Ready Operations
![multi-model](recordings/sales/multi-model.gif)

Production-grade monitoring, RBAC, and multi-tenant isolation for enterprise deployments.

## Demo Scenarios

Pre-configured scenarios showcasing llm-d capabilities:
