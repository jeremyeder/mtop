### Scenario 5: 🤖 Multi-Model Enterprise Portfolio
**Value Proposition:** "Manage diverse LLM portfolio with unified monitoring"

**Demo Command:**
```bash
./mtop
# Press 'q' to exit after showing real-time monitoring
```

**Talking Points:**
- **Diverse workloads:** "Claude, GPT-4, Llama, Mixtral - all monitored unified"
- **Performance comparison:** "Real-time token generation rates across models"
- **Cost analysis:** "Per-model cost tracking and optimization recommendations"
- **Operational efficiency:** "Single pane of glass for entire LLM infrastructure"

**Key Metrics to Highlight:**
- Models monitored: 15+ simultaneously
- Cost visibility: Per-token pricing across all models
- Performance tracking: Real-time TTFT and throughput
- Operational overhead: 90% reduction vs manual monitoring

---

## 💡 Objection Handling

### "We already have Kubernetes monitoring"
**Response:** "mtop provides LLM-specific metrics Kubernetes can't see - token generation rates, TTFT optimization, GPU fractioning efficiency. It's the missing layer between infrastructure and AI workloads."

### "How is this different from Prometheus/Grafana?"
**Response:** "While Prometheus monitors containers, mtop monitors AI workloads. We track token economics, SLO compliance, and provide actionable recommendations Prometheus can't deliver."

### "What about vendor lock-in?"
**Response:** "mtop is open source and cloud-agnostic. It works with any Kubernetes cluster, any GPU type, any LLM model. You own your monitoring stack."

### "Implementation complexity concerns"
**Response:** "Zero-code deployment. Install via Helm chart, auto-discovers your models, starts monitoring immediately. No configuration required."
